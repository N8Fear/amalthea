;;; Commentary:

;; Syntax and spell checking for both programming and regular languages, using
;; `flyspell' and `flycheck' to configure them. Requirements are that you need
;; to have `hunspell' installed for this to work, though `use-package' will try
;; to install it for you.

;;; Code:

;;; `flyspell':
;; The builtin spell checker for Emacs, this is a really nice little package
;; that automatically does it's magic whenever it's needed. For programming
;; modes we use the builtin `prog-mode' version of Flyspell, and we then just
;; enable the regular version for `text-mode' buffers.

;;; `flyspell-correct':
;; The default correction window for Flyspell is awful, terribly so actually, so
;; we'll use a package to fix this. This creates a generic way of correcting
;; words and we'll use a Ivy-minibuffer to correct wording.
