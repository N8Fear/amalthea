;;; Commentary:

;; Provides auto completion powered by `Company', snippet expansions powered by
;; `Yasnippet' and `hippie-expand'.

;;; Code:

;;; `Company':
;; Instead of using something like `auto-complete' we'll use `Company' to give
;; us auto completion for variables, functions and so on.

;; Instead of using the default tooltip box that `Company' comes with we'll
;; instead shell out to a different package that gives us a really nice... box.
;; It allows for icons next to completion canditates as well as different colors
;; for various backends if the need is there.

;; box next to the completion window.

;;; `company-statistics':
;; When completing a candidate, save the candidate to a history file and sort
;; completions accordingly next time so the candidate is ranked higher than the
;; last time. Useful for when there are many options but you mostly select one
;; or a few of them.
