* Introduction
This is my Emacs configuration, there are many like it but this one is mine.
It's decently personalized, but it should be useful for either inspiration or
just straight-up copy-pasta. My configuration is managed by [[https://github.com/emacscollective/borg][borg]], which is a
really nice and simple way of managing your Emacs packages by version.

At the moment I'm running Emacs from the latest revision of the master branch,
which means the version is 27.0, I'm using this because of the ~early-init.el~
file, but this configuration will work with versions below 27.0 too as it
concatenates the ~early-init.el~ file into the ~init.el~ file.

I've named my Emacs configuration ~Amalthea~, I have no recollection of why
anymore, other than the fact that I still think it's a cool name. It's named
after one of the minor moons of Jupiter.
