;;; Commentary:

;; Configuration for the Haskell language, this package requires you to have
;; `stack' installed, as `intero' uses it.

;;; Code:

;;; `haskell-mode':
;; The main focal point of the Haskell editing experience, there's no magic
;; here. All it does is add some modes to `haskell-mode', exclude some project
;; files from `recentf' and set a few common sense settings.
(use-package haskell-mode
  :ensure-system-package (brittany . "stack install brittany")
  :delight (subword-mode)
  :ghook ('haskell-mode-hook (list #'interactive-haskell-mode #'subword-mode #'haskell-auto-insert-module-template))
  :init
  (add-to-list 'recentf-exclude (expand-file-name "~/.stack/global-project/.stack-work/")) ;; Exclude Intero REPL from recentf
  :config
  (setq haskell-compile-cabal-build-command "stack build --fast" ;; We're using Stack instead of Cabal due to Intero
        haskell-process-type 'stack-ghci                         ;; Always use Stack with GHCi
        haskell-process-suggest-remove-import-lines t            ;; Suggest removing imports
        haskell-process-auto-import-loaded-modules t             ;; Automatically load modules
        haskell-interactive-popup-errors nil                     ;; Unnecessary because of Flycheck
        haskell-process-show-overlays nil))                      ;; Same as above

;;; `intero':
;; The main workhorse for working with Haskell, Intero is both a Haskell program
;; and a Emacs mode. It gives you a way to load your code into the REPL, work
;; inside the REPL, send code back and so on. It's similar to SLIME for Common
;; Lisp.
(use-package intero
  :after haskell-mode
  :commands intero-global-mode
  :delight " Î»"
  :init (intero-global-mode))

;;; `flycheck-haskell':
;; We obviously need some kind of error correction, for this we'll use `hlint',
;; which is a linter for Haskell code. We need to manually add this as a warning
;; to Flycheck, but this is done after both Intero and Flycheck has loaded.
(use-package flycheck-haskell
  :after (intero flycheck)

  :ghook ('flycheck-mode-hook #'flycheck-haskell-configure)
  :init (flycheck-add-next-checker 'intero '(warning . haskell-hlint)))

;;; `hlint-refactor':
;; A lot of the time `hlint' can also apply fixes to our code for us, this is
;; done via this package. We install the required dependencies and add a few
;; keybindings for it.
(use-package hlint-refactor
  :ensure-system-package
  ((hlint . "stack install hlint")
   (refactor . "stack --resolver=nightly install apply-refact"))
  :general
  (amalthea-major-leader 'haskell-mode-map
